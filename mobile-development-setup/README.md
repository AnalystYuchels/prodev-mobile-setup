# Setting Up and Testing Your Mobile Development Environment

## 📌 Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth experience, we’ll be using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

This setup will prepare your system for upcoming React Native projects.


## ✅ Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js LTS** – [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **VS Code** (recommended IDE) – [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Operating System** – macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Expo Go** on your physical device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for completing mobile development tasks efficiently.


## 📲 Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development, mobile apps usually need emulators for testing. Running emulators can be costly and resource-heavy, especially when accounting for many device types (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, different Android versions).  

**Expo Go** provides a lightweight, cost-effective solution by letting you test React Native apps directly on your physical Android or iOS device.


## 🚀 Steps to Install Expo Go
1. Visit the official Expo Go page: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)  
2. Select the latest **SDK version**.  
3. Install Expo Go on your device:  
   - **Android:** [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)  
   - **iOS:** [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)  
4. Open the **Expo Go** app on your device.  
5. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.  


## 📝 Documentation Task
